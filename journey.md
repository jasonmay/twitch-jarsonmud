## Yaegi vs Compiled Python

As referenced in my Twitch channel page, I chose to use compiled Python in my [design document](https://github.com/jasonmay/twitch-jarsonmud/blob/master/DESIGN.md).

[Yaegi](https://github.com/containous/yaegi) is something I recently learned about, that might be worth exploring. I am going in blind, but we will be evaluating and debating on whether this has the flexibility we want, and if not, we will disregard this as a contender and stay the course with compiled Python!

Hopefully we get to some actual AST building and benchmarking!
